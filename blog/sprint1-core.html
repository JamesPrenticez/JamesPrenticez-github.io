<p>I am always dreaming about the future and what it holds. Never satisfied with what I’ve got - things can always be better. We could live in a eutopia, have flying cars and robots that serve our every whim.</p>

<p>It is easy to get caught up in the future, become inpatient with the  status quo and, end up frustrated. This can also be summarized as <b>result orientated thinking.</b></p>

<p>The flipside of living in the future is to instead live in the past. Reflecting on past event can be a valuable exercise – a way to learn and improve. However over indulging can lead to a negative spiral of thought. The brain tends to exaggerate negative experiences and under-play the positive ones.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that both the future and the past can only exist in the present. Without you actively giving energy to these realms they do not exist – a figment of your imagination.</p>

<p><b>Process orientated thinking</b> focuses on enjoying the journey of life and getting satisfaction each step of the way - enjoy the struggle. This is way to sustained growth.</p>

<p>I think this concept best summed up in the ancient Chinese proverb “The best time to plant a tree was 20years ago, the next best time is today” illustrates that we can learn from the past, take action today and influence the future. </p>

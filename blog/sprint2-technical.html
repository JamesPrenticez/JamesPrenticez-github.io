<p>The first this you need to know to understand positioning of elements inside a webpage is that element acts like a block inside a grid</p>

<p>By default, div elements are set to <b>display: block</b> this means if you give them height/width properties and create a rectangle/square. Multiple div elements will inherently stack one on top of the next, vertically</p>

<p>This contrasts with span elements which are by default set to <b>display: inline-block.</b> Now we can imagen that our blocks are waiting inline at the grocery store waiting to be served. </p>

<img src="../img/div.png" width="200" height="200">

<p>But how do we know where these blocks will appear on the screen? Will they be in the center, top-left, top-right or perhaps at the bottom of the page.</p>

<img src="../img/span.png" width="200" height="200">

<p>Remember the we said webpages are just like blocks displayed on a gird?</p>

<img src="../img/axsis.png" width="200" height="200">

<p>That grid like a piece of paper from your highschool maths book. Now lets imagen you got kicked outside the classroom for being disruptive and your friend has drawn a funny picture on your book, they then show you this picture through the window while you stand outside.</p>

<p>That window is your <b>viewport</b> and your math book is our <b>webpage</b>.</p>

<h3>Fixed</h3>
<p>A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport or the browser windows itself -not the underlying webpage. No matter if you scroll up and down the element will stay fixed to the window not the underlying grid. </p>

<h3>Absolute</h3>
<p>This type of positioning gives web developers 100% control. You can display the element exactly where you want it on the <b>webpage.</b> You can use the attributes such as: top, left, bottom, down and right to set its location</p>

<p>Absolute positioning is inherited from the next parent element. If the child sits inside a parent element it will move inside that box. If no such parent exists then it will position relative to the underlying html.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember about absolute positing is that these elements are <b>removed from the flow</b> and do not and are not affected by other elements on the page. This is a serious thing to consider every time you use absolute positioning. Its overuse or improper use can limit the flexibility of your site</p>

<h3>Relative(to iself)</h3>
<p>This is rather confusing. If you set position: relative; on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will have no effect on itâ€™s positioning at all.</p>

<p>If you do give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 100px right:100px, it will shift its position 100 pixels down and 100px left from where it would normally be on the <b>webpage</b>.</p>
